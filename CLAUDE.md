# JTI Promotion Scheduling POC

## Instructions for Claude

- After **any backend change**, run: `cd backend && ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m black . && ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m isort . && ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m flake8 .`
  - Or via Makefile: `make be-lint`
- After **any frontend change**, run: `cd frontend && npm run lint`
  - Or via Makefile: `make fe-lint`
- Fix all lint errors before considering a task complete.

## Source Excel Schedule — Structure & Attributes

The file `SWAP TTL Program Jan '26 Week 3.xlsx` is the manually produced weekly promoter visit schedule. It is the primary reference for what the tool must automate. It contains 10 sheets:

## Open Questions & Clarifications Needed

This is an early-stage PoC. The following questions are unresolved and should be clarified with stakeholders before building the scheduling logic. More may emerge as development progresses.

### Promoter / Programme types

1. ~~**`Radical` programme roster**~~ — **Resolved.** Radical rows represent external promoters visiting a POS. Missing `Brand Ambassador` and `Base` values in the current Excel are **data quality issues**, not by design. This data will be available when the tool integrates with JTI's data infrastructure.

2. **`Exclusive` vs `Permanent`** — Both appear in `Personnel` as JTI employees. What is the practical distinction? Is `Exclusive` a third-party contractor exclusively dedicated to JTI (not on direct payroll), while `Permanent` is a full-time direct hire?

3. **`Base` column** — Appears to be the promoter's home city; always null for `Radical` rows. Is that because Radical promoters are local to the POS area and don't have a tracked base, or simply that the data isn't captured?

### Scheduling logic & output

4. **`schedules` sheet as output target** — This sheet looks like a structured output template (`promoterCode`, `posCode`, `startAt`, `endAt`) meant to feed a downstream system. Is the primary deliverable of this tool rows in this format, and what system consumes it?

5. **`Priority` sheet: `Day 1/2/3` + `Time 1/2/3`** — Are these the manually determined optimal visit slots per POS that the AI tool should learn to generate automatically? If so, are they the ground truth for model training/validation?

### POS & territory data

6. **`W/H` column** — Is the warehouse/distributor relevant to scheduling? E.g. are certain promoters tied to specific distributors, or does it only affect logistics?

7. **`Contractor` column** (`JTI`, `Competition`, `Owner`) — Does the contractor type affect which POS gets scheduled, which programme type is used, or which promoter is assigned?

---

## Business Context

### What this tool is

An AI-powered **promoter scheduling application** being piloted in **JTI Greece**. It automates the planning of promoter/informer visits to Points of Sale (POS — retail kiosks) to maximise sales impact.

### The problem being solved

Currently, the scheduling process is entirely manual:

- **Manual planning**: Field teams check each POS individually in BI tools to identify the best visit times — slow and error-prone.
- **Complex resource allocation**: Deciding visit frequency per kiosk based on day/time, assigned promoter, and customer traffic requires human judgement and is hard to optimise at scale.
- **Suboptimal timing**: Visits often happen during low-traffic periods, reducing sales opportunities and wasting promoter time.

### Available input data

Historical activity data with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Activity start & end date/time | When the visit occurred |
| POS code & location | Which kiosk was visited |
| Devices sold per activity | Sales outcome of each visit |
| Interviews conducted | Engagement metric per visit |
| Assigned informer/promoter | Which promoter ran the activity |
| Day/time execution patterns | Recurring scheduling patterns |

### Expected outputs from the tool

1. **Complete visit plan per POS** — automated recommendations for day, time, visit frequency, and promoter assignment.
2. **Peak time detection** — identifies high-traffic, high-sales time windows per POS from historical data.
3. **Optimised visit frequency** — suggests how often each POS should be visited to maximise sales impact.
4. **Promoter–POS matching** — matches the most effective promoter/informer to each POS and time slot based on past performance.
5. **Exportable output** — full visit plan exportable as Excel, CSV, or PDF for field execution.

### Scope

This repository is a **pilot POC for Greece**. The goal is to validate the technical approach and business value before broader rollout.

## Backend

### Python Environment

- Virtual environment: `backend/.venv/` (Python 3.14)
- Dependency manager: **uv** (installed inside the venv)
- uv binary: `backend/.venv/Scripts/uv.exe`

**Never use `pip` directly or `requirements.txt`. Always use `uv`.**

```bash
# Install a package
backend/.venv/Scripts/uv.exe pip install <package>

# Activate venv (PowerShell)
backend/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

### Stack

- Django 6.x
- Django REST Framework
- djangorestframework-simplejwt — JWT auth
- django-cors-headers

### Authentication

- JWT via `djangorestframework-simplejwt`
- Access token lifetime: **8 hours**
- Refresh token lifetime: **7 days**, rotation enabled
- Token blacklist enabled (logout invalidates refresh token)

| Endpoint            | Method | Auth required | Description             |
|---------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `/api/auth/login/`  | POST   | No            | Returns access + refresh tokens |
| `/api/auth/logout/` | POST   | Yes           | Blacklists refresh token |
| `/api/auth/me/`     | GET    | Yes           | Returns current username |
| `/api/hello/`       | GET    | Yes           | Hello world             |

All endpoints require authentication by default (`IsAuthenticated` as DRF default).

### User Management

No registration from frontend — users are created via **Django Admin** at `/admin/`.

```bash
make be-createsuperuser   # create first admin user
```

### Linting (Python)

| Tool   | Purpose             | Config           |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| black  | Code formatter      | `pyproject.toml` |
| isort  | Import sorter       | `setup.cfg`      |
| flake8 | Style/error checker | `setup.cfg`      |

- `max-line-length = 88` (matches black)
- `.venv` and `migrations` excluded from all tools

---

## Frontend

- Framework: React 19 + Vite 6
- Directory: `frontend/`
- Dev server proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8000`

### Auth Flow

1. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
2. Login page posts credentials to `/api/auth/login/`
3. Access + refresh tokens stored in `localStorage`
4. `authHeaders()` helper injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API calls
5. Logout calls `/api/auth/logout/` (blacklists refresh token) and clears storage

### Theming

JTI brand colors defined in `src/theme.js`:

| Token        | Value     | Usage                     |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| `bgPage`     | `#141414` | Page background           |
| `bgCard`     | `#1e1e1e` | Cards, forms              |
| `bgNavbar`   | `#0f0f0f` | Navbar                    |
| `bgInput`    | `#2a2a2a` | Input fields              |
| `text`       | `#ffffff` | Primary text              |
| `textMuted`  | `#aaaaaa` | Secondary text            |
| `border`     | `#2e2e2e` | Borders                   |
| `buttonBg`   | `#ffffff` | Primary button background |
| `buttonText` | `#141414` | Primary button text       |

Font: **Inter** (Google Fonts)

### Linting (JS)

| Tool   | Purpose | Config             |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| ESLint | Linter  | `eslint.config.js` |

Plugins: `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`
